# Status-Hackathon
## Betbot a bot for betting beer (and such) with friends!

Repo for the status hackathon

### Why we made this app

It also started with the original idea BeerBot, in which people in a friend group could track how many beers (arbitury storer of value) they owed each other. we realised that this idea could be extended to use any token that the group could want as well as add functionality as people could bet on things. Friendly things. this app is intended to be used by families or close friends in order to keep track of minor debts that could otherwise hinder the growth of the friend group.

each group has its own zero sum token (some people have negative tokens and sum have positive. all summing up to 0). This functionality is pretty cool has coins will never need to minted or burnt in the traditional way but would rather be sent to the person that wins the bet when the betting period has expired.

### Instruction for use

- normal running I guess, should be intuitive once you get it going

### Our challenges
- We originally had a lot of trouble with getting status to update after making a change to the code.
  - a fix for our problem would have probably been more together troubleshooting docs (even though people like cryptowanderer did help a lot!)
- Once we got started using the API properly the development was not perticlarly bad concidering it is still in its early stages.
- Solidity was an issue and getting it emplimented inside of status. this was fixed after we were told of cool tools such as (browser tool)
- We had never done any large scale projects in ethereum or made an actual dapp more than just a simple token creator so learning all that was also a huge challenge!

### TODO:

- send token functionality
- settle bets
- create bets
